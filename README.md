## Introduction

Feno is a frontend programming language that offers a complete package of new tools to improve the development of static websites. We design each part of Feno in detail focusing on improving the experience of each programmer and at the same time Feno becomes a powerful language by having different functionalities such as: Components, Layouts, Global Storage and at the same time offers tools never seen before. : Meta files, Modules, Cubes and more. All this makes Feno one of the best options to use.
